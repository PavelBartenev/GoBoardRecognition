# Go Board State Recognition

The repository is dedicated to the recognition of the state of Go board. In the .ipynb notebooks you can find code for board detection, transformation and the estimation of stones positions.

This project was developed for Introduction to CV course at Skoltech.

Below you can see the examples of board and cells detection and also the metrics of board state estimation.
